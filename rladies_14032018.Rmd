#Blogging with the Blogdown package

Starting is easier than you think!

![Scary](/images/what.gif)


???

This will be a very basic introduction to starting a blog/website with blogdown

Essentially this is a quick and dirty starting point 

will get you going in a short amount of time, 

if you chose to not tweak things too much!

---

#In case of emergency!

Follow the advice in [Blogdown by Xie, Thomas, and Presmanes Hill](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) 

![blogdown_book](images/blogdown_book.png) 

and the blog post by [@JonTheGeek: Blogging in About Ten Minutes](http://jonthegeek.com/2018/02/27/blogging-in-ten-minutes/)

---

#What will you need?

## In R
 
- Rstudio
- Working knowledge of R Markdown 
- The blogdown package (available via CRAN)


##Outside R

- Git and Github account
- Netlify account 

???

I will **briefly** cover these steps, however there are many good guides online.

#Git and Github

You will need to create a [Github](https://github.com/) account- Your static site "lives" here 

You will also need to install Git on your machine and enable it in R studio

#Create your new Github repo

Go to [Github New Repository](https://github.com/new) > click the Plus symbol (top right) of your account landing page.

![github_new](images/github_new.png)


???

Once you have a github account

This is where it will differ slightly from the Blogdown book, but I find this workflow simplifies it even more!

repo name doesn't matter! Here I've created a repo called my blog (and if you go to my github account, you can see it there)


---
#Create your RStudio project

In RStudio, choose File > New Project. 

Choose Version Control > Git

Paste the URL of your git repository

![git_repo](images/git_repo.png)

---
#And now, Blogdown!

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(blogdown)
install_hugo()
new_site()
```

![blog generated](images/blog_generated.png)



???

Blogdown will generate the necessary file structure within your package and populate some example files as well as CSS files for the theme, etc.


---
#Themes

Themes can be found at the [Hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/) website

![Hugo website](images/hugo_site.png)
---

#Installing a theme

Recommended to do at the new_site() step!

```{r eval =FALSE}
new_site(theme = "gcushen/hugo-academic")
```


???

Can be tricky to go backwards and try to change themes after the fact

Requires messing around with the config.toml file

May just be less trouble to pick your theme and run with it!

---

#Configuration file

![config_file](images/config1.png)

???

Here we will start tweaking the website a little bit!


title: Pick a title for your blog

google analytics: Account URL if you have one

discus: Account if you have one


post = the way the URL format of your post will be. Unless you want something specific, the default should be suitable


name: Whatever you'd like to be known as

URL: URL to your about section - Can be changed later on!

About: set up to direct to your "About" file

Github/Twitter: populate with names/links

Description: can be updated if you want

Baseurl - This will be changed later on

---

#About.md

![about](images/about.png)
???

Can change to update the Title and Date and content

---

#Cleaning out unecessary files

New site is populated with example files.

Navigate to content folder > post > 

Delete the files found inside this folder.


![Fresh](images/fresh.gif)

---

#Build/Serve site

Seeing the site is the best part!

Navigate to your Addins dropdown menu 

Select **Serve Site** and admire the awesomeness in your Viewer window!

![boss](images/boss.gif)

???
Now you can go back some steps if you want to tweak things. 
Or start over completely with another theme.


---
#Time to...

![rip](images/rip_bandaid.gif)


---

#Commit to Github!


![commiting](images/commiting.png)


???

Go select the Git tab in the top right corner

Make sure you stage all the files
 
Include a commit message

Press commit

Then press Push

Follow the instructions asking for username and password if they pop up!


---
#Check if committed properly

![commited](images/commited.png)

---
???
Go to github and to the repo's page and check if the documents have been committed properly to the repo itself.
