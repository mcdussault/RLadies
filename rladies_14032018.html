#Blogging with the Blogdown package

Starting a blog is with blog down is easier than you think!

![Scary](/images/what.gif)




---

#In case of emergency later on!

Follow the advice in [Blogdown by Xie, Thomas, and Presmanes Hill](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) 

![blogdown_book](images/blogdown_book.png) 

and the blog post by [@JonTheGeek: Blogging in About Ten Minutes](http://jonthegeek.com/2018/02/27/blogging-in-ten-minutes/)

#What will you need?

## In R
 
- Rstudio
- Working knowledge of R Markdown 
- The blogdown package (available via CRAN)


##Outside R

I (briefly) cover the following necessary steps:

- Git and Github account
- Netlify account 


---

#Git and Github

You will need to create a [Github](https://github.com/) account- Your static site "lives" here 

You will also need to install Git on your machine and enable it in R studio

#Help with Git!

---
#Create your new Github repo!

Go to [Github New Repository](https://github.com/new) &gt; click the Plus symbol (top right) of your account landing page.

![github_new](images/github_new.png)


???
This is where it will differ slightly from the Blogdown book, but I find this workflow simplifies it even more!

repo name doesn't matter!
Initialise with a Readme file

---
#Create your RStudio project!

In RStudio, choose File &gt; New Project. 

Choose Version Control &gt; Git

Paste the URL of your git repository

![git_repo](images/git_repo.png)

---
#And now, Blogdown!


```r
library(blogdown)
install_hugo()
new_site()
```

![blog generated](images/blog_generated.png)


---
#Themes

Themes can be found at the [Hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/) website

![Hugo website](images/hugo_site.png)
---

#Installing a theme

Recommended to do at the new_site() step!


```r
new_site(theme = "gcushen/hugo-academic")
```


???

Can be tricky to go backwards and try to change themes after the fact

Requires messing around with the config.toml file

May just be less trouble to pick your theme and run with it!

---

#Configuration file

![config_file](images/config1.png)

???

Here we will start tweaking the website a little bit!


title: Pick a title for your blog

google analytics: Account URL if you have one

discus: Account if you have one


post = the way the URL format of your post will be


name: Whatever you'd like to be known as

URL: URL to your about section - Can be changed later on!



Github/Twitter: populate with names/links

Description: can be updated if you want

Baseurl - This will be changed later on

---

#About.md

![about](images/about.png)
???

Can change to update the Title and Date and content

---

#Cleaning out unecessary files

New site is populated with example files.

Navigate to content folder &gt; post &gt; 

Delete the files found inside this folder.


![Fresh](images/fresh.gif)

---

#Build/Serve site

Seeing the site is the best part!

Navigate to your Addins dropdown menu 

Select **Serve Site** and admire the awesomeness in your Viewer window!

![boss](images/boss.gif)

???
Now you can go back some steps if you want to tweak things. 
Or start over completely with another theme.


---
#Time to...

![rip](images/rip_bandaid.gif)


---

#Commit to Github!


![commiting](images/commiting.png)


???
Go select the Git tab in the top right corner

Make sure you stage all the files
 
Include a commit message

Press commit

Then press Push

Follow the instructions asking for username and password if they pop up!

---

#Check if committed properly

![commited](images/commited.png)

---

#Deploying on Netlify

Sign up for an account at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

Once signed up, click on New Site from Git

![new_site](images/netlify_newsite.png)
---

#Deploying on Netlify

Select Github as the source of the site under Continuous Development

Select the repository where your site lives

![continuoous_dev](images/continuous_dev.png)

---

#Deploying on Netlify

Set the Build Command to hugo_0.19 and the Publish directory to public

![deploy](images/deploy.png)
---

#Deploying on Netlify

Once you click deploy, it will take you to your general settings.
Here you may change the site name!

![site_name](images/site_name.png)
After the site is deployed with the right name, go back to your config.toml file and change the URL at the very top 
---

#Writing your first post


From the Addins menu, select New Post

![new_post](images/first_post.png)
Write your content, commit, and **push to Github**! Netlify will update on its own, as will your site!

---
#Check all is well at your website
